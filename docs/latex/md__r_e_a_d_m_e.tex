This is a library designed to help with calculating orbits in three dimensions.

Currently it is no in library form, but rather a Code\+Blocks projects, but I will be shortly transitioning it over to a static library.

Known Problems\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Orbital State Vectors are not calculated 
\end{DoxyItemize}
